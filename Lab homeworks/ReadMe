Laboratory homework:
1. analogRGBControl
  Description:
  Hardware used: 3 potentiometers, 1 RGB-led, 3 resistors(330 ohm), wires, arduino, connector cable.
  The code reads the values of 3 potentiometers using the analogRead function 
  and uses the analogWrite function to directly control each of the RGB colors of the led.
    
2. knockDetector
  Description:
  Hardware used: 1 passive buzzer, 1 active buzzer, 1 pushbutton, 2 resistors, wires, arduino, connector cable.
  The code reads the values of the passive buzzer and after an interval of time it start a sound using the active buzzer. 
  The pushbutton stops the sound.
